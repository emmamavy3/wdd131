      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        I want to make a site that will allow me to view all my favorite movies
        and books. It should also help me receive recommendations from others.
        This website will also eventually help others keep track of their
        favorite books and movies.
      </p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        I am the main audience especially at the start but I would like to make
        it a site where people can share recommendations. That would make it so
        movie and book lovers can also have a place to record their favorite
        books and movies.
      </p>
      <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
      <p>
        I will implement a dark mode toggle using JavaScript and dynamically
        display books and movies by fetching data from a database or user
        submissions.
      </p>

      <h3>Color Palette</h3>
      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

        With the IMF now disbanded and Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) out in the cold,
        a new threat -- called the Syndicate -- soon emerges. The Syndicate is a
        network of highly skilled operatives who are dedicated to establishing a
        new world order via an escalating series of terrorist attacks. Faced
        with what may be the most impossible mission yet, Ethan gathers his team
        and joins forces with Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), a disavowed British
        agent who may or may not be a member of this deadly rogue nation
